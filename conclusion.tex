\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

Blockchains have the potential to disrupt incumbent applications on the data sharing economy. In addition to this, the
Transportation industry is going through a radical shift due to the new types of data and applications that have become
available, for instance, due to mobile phones, crowdsourced data, cheap hardware sensor networks and sophisticated
analysis and planning algorithms that can utlize this data.

By bring the blockchain technology and designing it from the grounds up for Transportation applications we have created
the worlds first blockchain specifically tailored for Transportation applications. Our mission is for Latitude to become
the de-facto platform for all transportation applications by building the right constructs for trusted, privacy aware,
secure and verifiable data and computation sharing/enforcement.

Our mission is to build Latitude to support applications across the planet and across different modes of transport. We
are excited by how Latitude stands to disrupt existing applications such as Ridesharing, mapping, location sharing and
analytics and the driver-behavior industry (UBIs).

The full-whitepaper shall contain a deeper dive into the mechanics of the Latitude blockchain including details on how
the smart contract system, the cryptographic proofs and the datastore would function.
