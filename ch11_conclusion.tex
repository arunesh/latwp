\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper has introduced BigchainDB. BigchainDB fills a gap in the decentralization ecosystem: a decentralized database, at scale.
BigchainDB performance points to $1$ million writes per second, sub-second latency, and petabyte capacity.
It has easy-to-use and efficient querying.
It features a rich permissioning system that supports public and private blockchains.
It is complementary to decentralized processing technologies (smart contracts) and decentralized file systems, and can be a building block within blockchain platforms.
