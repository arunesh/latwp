\section{The Latitude Blockchain}\label{sec:design}


Overview of design principles:

Datastore
 - Optimized for Geographic, Geo-spatial data.
 - Location, Mapping data and computation.
 - Ability to Store, index, query and build smart contracts optimized for such data.
 - Support for various spatial indexes.
 - Location heatmaps.
 - Indexing road and driving data.
 - Primitives for storing driving data for autonomous vehicles

Cryptographic primitives for:
 - Security and privacy of data.
 - Anonymity guarantees using cryptographic set operations.
 - Enforcement of privacy when sharing data.
 - Sharing of “computation” instead of data when possible.
 - For eg: Sharing of DriverScore using a vetted algorithm.
 - Sharing proximity to a landmark instead of lat/lng.
 - Ability to find bad actors.
 - Detect privacy, anonymity and security violations.


Smart contract system for Transportation applications.
 - Ability to convert “policies” such as GDPR into smart contract code.
 - Example, self destruct data after a time period.
 - Sandboxed trusted execution environment:
 - For algorithms:
   - DriverScore, Location heatmaps, Statistics.
   - Enforcing or verifying privacy and other govt policies/regulations.

Cryptographic proofs for applications:
 - Proof of Location. 
 - Proof of ride. 
 - Proof of mapping 
      (road/landmark exists or does not exist).
 - Proof of driver score 
 - Open, trusted, understood driver score computation algorithms.
 - Cryptographic proofs can be shared among entities, safely, securely.


Cryptoeconomics and Governance:
 - Crypto-incentives for honest operation.
 - Penalties for malicious intent.
 - Governance based on consensus and roles using a council.
 - Council members elected using voting, stake and established trust.
 - Some council members can have restricted access.
 - Eg: US govt can have voting rights on US data/users, etc.

User incentives:
 - Users have full control over their data and computation.
 - Users can issue or request proofs to carry over to other applications.
 - User’s have incentive to share data, participate in improving the common denominator.
 - Malicious intent, Byzantine behavior.
   - Can be detected using a combination of consensus and incentives.
   - Best interest of users to act honestly by design.

Performance:
- Transaction speed. Data throughput. Storage capabilities.
